# Syllable Counter using a State Machine
This project is for practice using state machine to count syllables in words. 2 solutions is used that are use a simple non-OO approach (enum to define states) and the OO approach (interface or abstract class to define states).

The package named `simplesyllablecounter` is for the first solution.

And, the `oosyllablecounter` package os for the second solution.

The Main class in both 2 package will show a reference source, total syllables, number of words, and the elapsed time of the process since reading the file in second on the console as a below example.

> Reading words from dictionary.txt<br>
> Counted 103679 syllables in 38781 words<br>
> Elapsed time: 0.152 sec <br>
